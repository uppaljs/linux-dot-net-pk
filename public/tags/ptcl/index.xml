You will also need to change your user agent , This can be done by adding the below parameter in sip_profiles/external.xml</description>

      <description>PTCL has recently launched an app called “SmartLink” , Which provides you access to your phone line over SIP , essentially providing landline access from anywhere.
Since the land-line I have is only used for DSL and SmartTV, I wanted to set it up on SIP , so I can access it from any device.
PTCL uses Huawei SoftX 3000 Soft Switches for this service , I have had experience on these switches from my previous jobs and I know that it requires PRACK support to start off , In addition , while configuring , I noticed that the user_agent also needs to be set to a certain value for the registration to be successful.</description>
