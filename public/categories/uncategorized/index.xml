      <description>I was stuck with an iPhone purchased in the middle-east where Apple blocks FaceTime â€“ Turns out that its just a matter of Carrier Bundles â€“ Apple , from iOS 7 , started signing the carrier bundles , so they couldnâ€™t be modified by end-customers , any modification would result in change of the signature with the modification over-written on reboot with a standard bundle. A developer team from china enabled modifications by releasing a com-center patch that allows an over-ride for the signature check.</description>

      <description>Was playing around with Mbuni for a friend of mine , who wanted to use it as a VASP gateway and interconnect it with an operator over MM7. Spent a little while configuring it and thought of posting the configs here for anyone whoâ€™s trying to achieve a similar configuration.
Mbuni consits of

      <description>Hi,
I wanted a way to quickly pick , loadup and analyze tickets from our IN platform, ( weâ€™re talking about 1.3 Mil + rows for one file in peak hours ) Waseem [ http://convergence.pk ] , was kind enough to spare some time for the setup and we ended up with infobright [ http://infobright.com ] community edition.
Infobrightâ€™s based on MySQL and uses knowledge base + vertical coloums , which end up making queries run ridiculously fast.</description>

      <title>Reverse SSH Tunnel</title>
      <link>https://linux.net.pk/reverse-ssh-tunnel/</link>

      <description>ISPs in PK donâ€™t generally allow incoming traffic to your public IP rendering it useless, this is a real pain , when you want to access your machine from a remote location. The solution to it is a reverse ssh tunnel, which will work in the following way
[Home Machine] ==&amp;gt; {Middle Machine} ==&amp;gt; {You}
So youâ€™ll map a port from your home machine to your middle machine , which when connected to from the middle machine will forward all traffic to your home machine.</description>

      <description>Hereâ€™s my post / first review of Mobilink Infinity , A new WiMax service by Mobilink GSM in Pakistan.
I just subscribed to Mobilink Infinity for 1Mbps connection. The installers came over and installed it , the over all installation experience was okay , apart from the fact that they donâ€™t provide you the CPE password , so you cannot do any port mapping / port forwarding, so had to fight with them to get the access.</description>
