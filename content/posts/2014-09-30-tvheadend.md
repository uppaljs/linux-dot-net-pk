I have recently moved back to Pakistan and was pretty pissed off when I used the PTCL Smart TV STB &#8211; looked around for a solution and found a wonderful project called &#8220;TVHeadend[1]&#8221; &#8211; which not only takes IPTV multicast streams and converts them to HTTP Unicast but also does the same process for DVB-S , T & SAT/ SATIP.

Expect some interesting articles about TVHeadend soon!

Cheers
