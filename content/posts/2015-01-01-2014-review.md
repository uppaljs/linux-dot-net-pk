Unlike last year, I am not particularly enthusiastic about 2015. Part of this has to do with the way things are at the moment. If I were, I would have a hard time cheering people up.

Professionally, Telecom business is not expanding finally and is more focused on consolidating and cost reductions, with unexpected twists and turns that one has to navigate through.

I left my job in 2014 partly due to the extreme stress, which was driving me nuts and was hurting me both physically and mentally, and partly because I wanted to give starting and running my own shop a try.

Personally, it's been a mixed bag of a year, part of it being amazingly awesome and part being downright depressing. Overall, I didn't do enough, not as much as I wanted to do and wanted to grow professionally and personally, which is something I would like to address in 2015 hopefully.

Met a lot of new people in 2014, lost a few good friends as well. Overall, it was really really hard to stick to any plans in these conditions. I am hoping for a wonderful 2015, one where I can both professionally and personally grow!

Here's to hopefully a good 2015, maybe it will give us a break this time!

Cheers & Happy 2015!
