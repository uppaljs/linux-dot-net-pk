Just reached Riyadh this morning , apart from the random issues with the SPEEDX guy forgetting to ship my car keys to Karachi , the flight was un-eventful , Customs & Immigration was a breeze , The new immigration counters at Riyadh Airport are nice and the agent we went to , was extremely friendly and let us through in 10 minutes.

Oh , and this is how I feel after all the meat!! \*phew\*
