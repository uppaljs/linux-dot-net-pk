<span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Sylfaen;">Even if your hands are shaking</span>

<span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Sylfaen;">And your faith is broken</span>

<span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Sylfaen;">Even as the eyes are closing</span>

<span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Sylfaen;">Do it with a heart wide open</span>

<span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Sylfaen;">Say what you need to say …</span>

**(John Mayer &#8211; Say)**
