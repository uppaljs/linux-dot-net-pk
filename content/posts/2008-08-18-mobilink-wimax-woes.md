My Mobilink Wimax **Zyxel CPE** died tonight , somewhere around 10 , It first stopped camping and then just stopped broadcasting wifi signals as well , I tried ethernet , but of no use , the 4 port switch is the only thing that&#8217;s working. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s wrong with this equipment 🙁

Have logded a complaint on **369** , let&#8217;s hope they can fix this issue.

**UPDATE:** Turns out my indoor CPE was faulty. It has been replaced with a new one  🙂  and I am back online :-p
