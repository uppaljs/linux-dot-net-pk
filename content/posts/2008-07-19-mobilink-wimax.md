Here&#8217;s my post / first review of Mobilink Infinity , A new WiMax service by Mobilink GSM in Pakistan.

I just subscribed to Mobilink Infinity for 1Mbps connection. The installers came over and installed it , the over all installation experience was okay , apart from the fact that they don&#8217;t provide you the CPE password , so you cannot do any port mapping / port forwarding, so had to fight with them to get the access. The  
installers told me that its a 256K connection which will be shifted to 1mbps profile by tomorrow , which on repeated requests today was shifted to 1mbps.

The service in general is pathetic , i dont know if its just me or the overall user experience , but I get wayy high ping times ( 818ms to google ) and around 14 &#8211; 20 % packet loss all the time , My 1mbps wi-max gives me around 10 &#8211; 14k ( <a rel="nofollow" href="http://tinyurl.com/5jo2ez" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/5jo2ez</a> ) where my 512kb PTCL dsl downloads fine from the same machine.

Oh while I am at it , the VoIP service they provide with the Wimax is pathetic as well , it gets disconnected again and again, the voip quality sucks and incoming calls rarely work , people tell me they get number un-reachable even when calling from Mobilink.

By the way , I am a Wateen Wi-max , Worldcall , PTCL DSL & Link.NET DSL customer and comparing Mobilink&#8217;s Wimax service with them.

Here are my scores

Installation : 7/10  
Service : 0/10 Â ( it doesn&#8217;t work! )  
Voip : 4/10  
Customer Support : 8/10

I hope someone from Mobilink can help me out.
