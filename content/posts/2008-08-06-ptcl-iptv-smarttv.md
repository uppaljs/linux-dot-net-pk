PTCL has moved to a soft launch phase for their iptv product , and are calling PTCL DSL subscribers and offering them free IPTV connections ( NO charges for the Set Top Box + Service ) until commercial launch, they are currently advertising 101 channels along with the ability to rewind Geo News , HBO , ESPN and a couple of other channels.

I got a call yesterday and have subscribed for smartTV , let&#8217;s see how the installation goes. I&#8217;ll keep you guys updated.

Oh btw, if you want to avail this offer , just call **1236** and order and ask them for it. I&#8217;ve heard that their set-top boxes are based on linux, that just makes it more tempting for me ðŸ™‚ ! So Stay tuned!
