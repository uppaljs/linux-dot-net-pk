Hi,

I wanted a way to quickly pick , loadup and analyze tickets from our IN platform, ( we&#8217;re talking about 1.3 Mil + rows for one file in peak hours ) Â Waseem [ http://convergence.pk ] , was kind enough to spare some time for the setup and we ended up with infobright [ http://infobright.com ] community edition.

Infobright&#8217;s based on MySQL and uses knowledge base + vertical coloums , which end up making queries run ridiculously fast.

I&#8217;ve compared the results on 122 Million rows , running on oracle [ old setup ] & infobright Â [ new setup ] and the results are amazing , a single query on oracle takes 15 minutes to get the results , whereas the same query takes around 2 minutes on infobright ðŸ™‚

I&#8217;ll share the details for the setup , once its finished ðŸ™‚

Cheers.
