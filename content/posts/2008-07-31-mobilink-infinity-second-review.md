I&#8217;ve been using Mobilink Infinity Wimax service for the last 20 days or so , and wanted to share some numbers / graphs with users. I&#8217;ve been plotting it 24/7Â  by SNMP . The overall usage experience is okay now, the service works most of the times ( apart from the weird timeouts that i start getting sometimes ). The only thing we need from Mobilink Infinity team now , is to

**1. Reduce Network Latency** (Too many Hops inside their own Network)

**2. Stabilize the IP network** ( Get rid of the timeouts / packet losses )

<span style="color:#ffff00;"><strong>3. Open inbound traffic on our public IPs.</strong></span>

**4. Disable the ALGs on their gatewayÂ  ( SIP / H323 & FTP ).**

So , here are the stats , I&#8217;ve added some red & yellow lines , redÂ  is where infinity generally is , yellow is what i get on on networks ( which is still high ). Click on the graphs to enlarge them. The blank spaces you see , is where i lost total connectivity. The service has improved a lot from the initial review ðŸ™‚ Thanks to everyone at Mobilink Infinity for trying their best to solve the issues . Kudos to all of them!
