Next Month it will be my blog's (or attempt at a blog's) 2nd birthday - YAAY!

I just realized that I posted the last post after 1.5 Years. Everything has been a roller coaster ride since I moved to Afghanistan to work full time at a mobile operator. Just couldn't get enough time to update the blog, but I promise to keep posting off and on now.

Currently in Dubai for 2 weeks, hopefully will be in Pakistan for the weekend, India in 2 weeks and then off to Europe for 2 months in July.

Life's Good Alhamdulillah!

Cheers!
