Just a quick update , anthm @ freeswitch.org has fixed the bug in freeswitch that was preventing the switch to register with Wateen&#8217;s gateway. So , go , grab the latest freeswitch code from svn and compile. Here are the settings for your sip_profile

_<gateway name=&#8221;wateen.net&#8221;>  
<param name=&#8221;username&#8221; value=&#8221;021XXXXXX&#8221;/>  
**<param name=&#8221;auth-username&#8221; value=&#8221;021XXXXXX@wateen.net&#8221;/>**  
<param name=&#8221;password&#8221; value=&#8221;&#8221;/>  
<param name=&#8221;register-proxy&#8221; value=&#8221;sip:58.27.240.22:9060&#8243;/>  
<param name=&#8221;register&#8221; value=&#8221;true&#8221;/>  
</gateway>_
