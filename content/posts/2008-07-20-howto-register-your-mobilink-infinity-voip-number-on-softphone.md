Here are the SIP settings , if you want to use your VoIP number from Mobilink Infinity on a softphone.

You&#8217;ll have to first logon to your CPE admin interface , Browse to NAT -> ALG and Uncheck &#8220;SIP ALG&#8221; and click Apply. If you use an outdoor unit , do the same with the outdoor CPE as well.

Fireup x-lite and configure it with the following settings.

Server: 10.215.11.250  
Port: 5060  
UserID: 725XXXX  
Password: Your wi-max password  
Domain: Hauwei.com  
Authentication User: 725XXXX
