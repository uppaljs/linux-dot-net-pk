One word &#8211; Mikrotik&#8217;s Amazing!

The only problem is that they don&#8217;t have administration utility for OS X &#8211; Which causes nuisance when you only have a MAC at hand for setting up the router / switch.

I built a Winbox app using Wine Bottler for OS X which doesn&#8217;t use the dedicated graphic card and saves batter life. If anyone needs a copy &#8211; ping me and I&#8217;ll upload it!
